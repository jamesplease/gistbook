Each book is made up of a series of blocks.\n\nText blocks, like the one you're reading now, support [Github-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) and [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), so you can **format text** and write equations such as \\(x = 3 + 5\\). It also supports display math, as in\n\n$$\\int_a^b{x^2\\mathrm{d}x}$$\n\nAnd, of course, no Gistbook would be complete without Emoji. :+1:\n\nIn addition to text, you can write code, too. Gistbook supports `html`, `css`, and `javascript`. \n\n\n"},{"type":"html","source":"<!-- You can add code that can is output at the bottom of the Gistbook. -->\n<div>\n  Start making Gistbooks today!\n</div>"},{"type":"css","source":"/* Give the document some style */\ndiv {\n  padding: 20px;\n  border: 1px solid #eee;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n}\n\ndiv:first-child {\n  border-bottom: 0;\n}"},{"type":"javascript","source":"// This code will execute when you hit Run\nconsole.log('You just ran this Gistbook');"},{"type":"text","source":"You can even require in Node modules.\n"},{"type":"javascript","source":"// Every node module is available to you in your Gistbooks\nvar math = require('mathjs');\nvar $ = require('jquery');\n\nfunction norm(x, y) {\n  return math.sqrt(math.square(x) + math.square(y));\n}\n\n$('.output').text(norm(3, 4));"},{"type":"html","source":"<div>\n  The norm that we calculated is: <span class='output'></span>\n</div>"},{"type":"text","source":"To see this Gistbook in action, compile it by clicking the **run** button below :point_down:\n\nWant to make your own Gistbook?
