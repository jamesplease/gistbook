 * Define our app, which is just a thin container for
 * everything else.
 *
 * Note that this is a Marionette v3 prototype application! Don't
 * expect to use any of this code in your app just yet, even if
 * some of it looks cleaner than what's possible in v2. If you're
 * feeling really adventurous, check out the ../shims directory
 * to see all that's changed.
 *
 * We also set into motion all of the pieces
 * that make the webapp work, like routes, link
 * intercepting, and so on.
